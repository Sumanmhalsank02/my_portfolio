abstract: Timetable creation is a very tedious and time-consuming task. Years
  back when computers were not used to solve complex problems due to
  computational power, Scheduling classes was often done by humans which proved
  to be efficient but not perfect. Today with the explosion of Artificial
  intelligence and an exponential increase in computing power, using computers
  to solve new set of problems that previously could only be solved by humans
  became easy. Scheduling is one of the problems that can now be solved by
  computers with solutions acceptable or even better. To resolve the complexity
  and to reduce the efforts of generating timetables manually, some technologies
  can be implemented. However, scheduling is known to be a non-deterministic
  polynomial-time (NP) complete problem where, in order to find the best
  solution, every possible combination should be executed. Genetic Algorithm
  (search heuristic that is inspired by Charles Darwinâ€™s theory of natural
  evolution) is fit for scheduling problems as it creates a solution over time
  based on rules and criteria. This algorithm reflects the process of natural
  selection where the fittest individuals are selected for reproduction to
  produce offspring of the next generation using which we can optimize the
  Scheduling problem.
